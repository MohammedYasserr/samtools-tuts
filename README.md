# samtools-tuts
A short tutorial about how to convert and SAM file to a BAM file using "samtools ".
Motivation : To do anything meaningful with alignment data from BWA or other aligners (which produce text-based SAM output), we need to first convert the SAM to its binary counterpart, BAM format. The binary format is much easier for computer programs to work with. However, it is consequently very difficult for humans to read .
Steps : 1 - we need to get Ubuntu installed on your local machine https://lnkd.in/ddTDM-an ( Ubuntu tutorial ) .
2 - After get Ubuntu installed we open the Ubuntu terminal and follow the following bash command lines (Shown in the image )
